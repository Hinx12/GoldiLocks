Goldilocksâ€™ Bear Necessities

Description

The task falls to you: given descriptions of Goldilocks' needs and of the available porridge/chairs at the dinner table, tell Goldilocks which chair to sit in so the chair does not break, and the porridge is at an edible temperature.

Formal Input

The input begins with a line specifying Goldilocks' weight (as an integer in arbitrary weight-units) and the maximum temperature of porridge she will tolerate (again as an arbitrary-unit integer). This line is then followed by some number of lines, specifying a chair's weight capacity, and the temperature of the porridge in front of it.
